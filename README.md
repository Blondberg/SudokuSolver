# SudokuSolver
Solve the sudoku of your life.

Has currently no intuitive way of running. Need to go into the code to select the board you want to solve.

Will probably create some kind of gui one day.


In terminal:


chmod -x ./SudokuSolver/ (only have to do this once):

python -x ./SudokuSolver/ > out.txt (this will run the program and store the result in out.txt)
